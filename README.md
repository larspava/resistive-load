# resistive-load
# Question
Imagine a situation where you have a circuit able to activate and deactivate a purely resistive load with a microcontroller. It is required to control the load power over time depending on the situation and the power cannot be instantly changed from 0% to 100%. Explain in simple words a method to achieve such effect, looking at both hardware and firmware aspects of the system. If an inductive load is used instead of a resistive load, can the same triggering method be used or do special precautions need to be taken?

# Answer:
For a purely resistive circuit, it is possible to use a transistor together with a microcontroller by applying pulse width modulation (PWM). 
The transistor acts as a switch that will send current to the resistor according to the width of the pulses generated by the PWM. 
The microcontroller will determine the amount of energy based on the duty cycle, which is the duration of the pulse being on, 
represented as a percentage (time on within a complete cycle). A smooth increase or decrease in energy can be achieved through a 
PWM ramp implementation (PWM ramp-up/ramp-down), which involves gradually changing the duty cycle, for example, in steps of 5 to 10%, 
depending on the application.



When replacing the resistive load with an inductive one, the same circuit cannot be used because these components have different behaviors. 
The resistor consumes energy, while the inductor stores it and generates a magnetic field, which does not allow abrupt changes in current. 
The stored energy can generate voltage spikes that may damage the system when it is turned off. One solution is to use a diode in parallel 
with the inductor so that the current can flow when the transistor turns off, dissipating the magnetic field.
